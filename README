**** DO NOT USE THE CODE IN THIS REPOSITORY AT THE MOMENT ****

This repository represents a project to refactor and improve the code
of the first version of the Climacs editor.

We are working on replacing this version of Climacs by
the second version, called Second Climacs.

There are several reasons why we are working on Second Climacs to
replace this one:

  * The representation of the buffer is not so well adapted to
    features such as incremental parsing.

  * The Common Lisp parser, while better than that of Emacs, is still
    not good enough, and totally non-maintainable.  We think we know
    how to make a better one.

  * Climacs is intimately tied to McCLIM.  We would like to isolate
    the GUI from the rest of the code so as to make it easier to
    create different GUIs.

  * We want to improve the entire infrastructure for incremental
    parsing of the buffer contents.

  * etc.
